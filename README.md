# aostrek
Command line Age Of Sigmar simulator
Pocket calculator for AoS battles, very much a work in progress. Started as a way to improve my Node skills. 

You'll need Node.js - https://nodejs.org/ and the aostrek code from here

Run `npm init` once
 
And then to run the app use  
  `node src/app.js`
